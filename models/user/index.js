      Hash the password so the hackers have a harder time
      When it comes time to determine if a plaintext password matches
      the hash, use bcrypt.compare()

      once again, we tag the function as "async" to let it run in the
      background without blocking other people's requests, and all
      functions that support Promises are called with "await", basically
      telling our code (even though it's still asynchronous, and not
      blocking anything else) to wait for the result of that function
      before processing the next instruction of the async function.
      Even though await "pauses" the code until a result is given, it only
      "pauses" the async function that is running in the background that
      called it.
      Without async/await, the following code would look something like this:

      bcrypt.hash(user.password, 10, (err, hash) => {
        if (err) {
          return err;
        }
        db.query(
          `INSERT INTO users
          (name, email, password_hash)
          VALUES
          (?, ?, ?)`,
          [user.name, user.email, password_hash],
          (err, results, fields) => {
            if (err) {
              return err;
            }
          }
        );
      });
